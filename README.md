# Chow Pal

This is a concept I'm playing around with that I want to extract the modules from at a later date. Living in Korea it has been annoying not really knowing what is in the food we're eating.  The idea was to create a "search by ingredient" for the local restaurants we'd tried so if we wanted to, say eat something "with pork" or "without beef" we could filter dish results based on our geographic location and price.
